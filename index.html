      <h1>Maui is the best place for family vacation</h1>
      <p>Maui is the best Hawaiian island for families. Not only is there plenty to do (beaches! Snorkeling! Farm
        Tours!),
        but there is also a wide range of accommodations that cater to family travelers.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Maui is an extremely family-friendly vacation destination thanks to the swimmable coves and bays, beginner
      snorkeling options, wide range of restaurants, and great weather. And almost all resorts on the island are
      kid-friendly</p>

    <p>What part of Maui is best for families?</P>

    <ul>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h2 class="card-title">There are two main areas families generally stay on Maui: Wailea or Ka’anapali. Both
            areas have great weather,
            snorkeling, and beaches. Deciding what part of the island is right for your family comes down to budget,
            proximity
            to activities, and vibe.</h2>
          <ul class="card-text">
            <li class="bg-primary">Stay in Ka’anapali if you’re looking for a lively atmosphere, more kid-friendly
              restaurants, and a number of
              three and four star resort options.</li>
            <li class="bg-success">Stay in Wailea if you want a slightly quieter atmosphere, huge resorts (with epic
              resort pools), and five-star
              accommodations.</li>

          <h1>1. Best Family Resort for Space: Fairmont Kea Lani</h1>
          <p>First, to any parent who knows the pain of squeezing into a tiny hotel room with our kids, the
            Fairmont hears you and is here to fix that. The Fairmont Kea Lani is an oceanfront luxury resort that
            only offers one-bedroom suites and two to three-bedroom villas. You will have space, a designated
            bedroom (or more), and you won’t trip over each other during your stay. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h1>2. Best Family Resort for You Budget: Ka’anapali Beach Hotel</h1>
          <p>There is something about the Ka’anapali Beach Hotel that will make you feel like you’re transported
            to the 1960’s Ka’anapali. It might be the decor, the building design, or the wide-open space, but the
            Ka’anapali Beach Hotel has a retro charm. Don’t expect to see many (or any) updates here.

            This is a mid-range hotel so you won’t have the luxury amenities that you’ll find at some of the other
            hotels on this list. Eating at the restaurant isn’t a memorable experience and you won’t find plush
            linens. But if you’re looking for a place where your family can get the best value for the location,
            this is the spot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h1>3. Best Family Resort for an Amazing Pool: Grand Wailea</h1>
          <p>If pools are a draw for you and your kids, this is the place to stay. This is the most elaborate system
            of pools you’ll find on the island: nine pools, four waterslides, plus a lazy river.

            Plus the grounds are huge and offer something different to explore at every turn (think: lush gardens,
            small waterfalls, and koi ponds). Your kids won’t get bored walking around the grounds. But, the elaborate
            grounds can feel crowded, which is why we think of this as more of a luxury hotel for kids than for
            adults. </p>

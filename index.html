      <h1>Maui is the best place for family vacation</h1>
      <p>Maui is the best Hawaiian island for families. Not only is there plenty to do (beaches! Snorkeling! Farm
        Tours!),
        but there is also a wide range of accommodations that cater to family travelers.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Maui is an extremely family-friendly vacation destination thanks to the swimmable coves and bays, beginner
      snorkeling options, wide range of restaurants, and great weather. And almost all resorts on the island are
      kid-friendly</p>

    <p>What part of Maui is best for families?</P>

    <ul>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h2 class="card-title">There are two main areas families generally stay on Maui: Wailea or Ka’anapali. Both areas have great weather,
            snorkeling, and beaches. Deciding what part of the island is right for your family comes down to budget,
            proximity
            to activities, and vibe.</h2>
          <ul class="card-text">
            <li class="bg-primary">Stay in Ka’anapali if you’re looking for a lively atmosphere, more kid-friendly
              restaurants, and a number of
              three and four star resort options.</li>
            <li class="bg-success">Stay in Wailea if you want a slightly quieter atmosphere, huge resorts (with epic
              resort pools), and five-star
              accommodations.</li>
